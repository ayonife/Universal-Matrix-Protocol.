## 📜 Overview
The **Universal Matrix Protocol** is a unified computational framework designed to translate real-world entities (Economics, Traffic, Health, Education) into standard mathematical objects (**State Vectors**) that can be optimized using Linear Algebra.

Instead of treating these sectors as separate silos, the Universal Matrix creates a "One Entity" architecture, allowing for cross-domain optimization (e.g., how Traffic Flow impacts Economic Velocity).

## 🧠 Core Architecture
The system is built on the **Matrix Hyperlanguage (MHL)**, which follows this logic:
1.  **Entities** $\rightarrow$ State Vectors ($v$)
2.  **Relationships** $\rightarrow$ Transformation Matrices ($A$)
3.  **Constraints** $\rightarrow$ Linear Inequalities ($Ax \leq b$)
4.  **Optimization** $\rightarrow$ $\min ||Tx - y||$

## 🛠️ Usage
The current repository contains the **MHL Kernel (v0.1)**, a Python-based proof of concept that demonstrates the "Skills Oracle" scenario (matching a Student Vector to a Job Market Vector).

### Running the Kernel
```bash
python matrix_kernel.py
